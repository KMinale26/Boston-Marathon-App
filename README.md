# Shiny App Project

## Boston Marathon 2023 Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this app is to analyze the Boston Marathon 2023 data and identify trends, performance factors, and demographic insights. 
This app creates an interactive design to explore race performance across variables such as age, gender, and finishing times. 
The user will be able to explore the trends by utilizing the slider to get more information about certain age groups, gender, and finishing time range. 
There are also visualizations of statistical analysis that have been done in order for the user to see graphs of the intended search. 
This work was collaboratively done with the help of Shine Chang, Leah Davis, and Byeolha Kim.
